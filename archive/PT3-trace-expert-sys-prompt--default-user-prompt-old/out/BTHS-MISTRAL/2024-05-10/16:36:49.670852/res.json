However, without additional context or information, it is impossible to know the exact test case ID for this scenario."

This user action shall result in the AG releasing the SCO connection.\" Therefore, it can be inferred that there should be a test case for verifying the release of an SCO connection initiated by a user action on the AG. However, I couldn't find a test case with that exact ID in the provided \"tests.json\" file. If there is a test case with the ID \"T-15\" that covers this requirement, please let me know and I will update my answer accordingly. Otherwise, you may need to add a new test case to your test suite to cover this requirement."
