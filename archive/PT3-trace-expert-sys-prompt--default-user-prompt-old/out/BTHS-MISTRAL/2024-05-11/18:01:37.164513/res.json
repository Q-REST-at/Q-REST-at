This user action shall result in the AG releasing the SCO connection.\" Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that one of the test cases covers the release of the SCO connection. However, without explicit confirmation, it is just an assumption.\n\nIf you have more information about test case T-15 or if it does not cover the requirement, please let me know and I will update my answer accordingly."
