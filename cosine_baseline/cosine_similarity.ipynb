            "['Audio Gateway Initiated ACL Connection Establishment Upon an internal or user generated event, the AG will initiate connection establishment. There are then two options as described in the  4.2.1 and  4.2.2. The SCO link establishment can take place anytime after the ACL connection establishment.', 'Using In-Band Ringing An in-band ring tone is an audible alert, such as a tone, melody, short music clip, that is transmitted by the AG, to the HS, to alert the user of an event; typically an incoming call. The AG may generate an in-band ring tone using the SCO connection to the HS. The AG decides how to use this SCO connection. When using an in-band ring tone, the AG shall not send the RING unsolicited result code to the HS3..', 'Using the RING message The AG will repeatedly send the RING unsolicited result code to the HS for a time period decided by the AG. The RING may be repeated for as long as the connection establishment is pending.', 'Headset Initiated ACL Connection Establishment A headset (HS) originated ACL connection is initiated (see 4.9) by a user action (e.g. pressing a button on the headset). Upon completion of a connection establishment that was initiated by pressing the “headset button”, the HS shall send the AT+CKPD=200 command to the AG. If the HS connection is initiated by an event other than a headset button press, the HS shall not send AT+CKPD=200. The AG may initiate a SCO connection after the completion of the ACL connection establishment, but before receiving the AT+CKPD=200 command from the HS. This may be desirable when the AG is a mobile phone. In all cases, the AG is responsible for establishing the SCO link if needed. Further internal actions may be needed on the AG to internally establish and/or route the audio stream to the HS4. (For a cellular phone a cellular call may need to be established, e.g. using last dialled number or a pre-programmed number. For a personal computer this may relate to VoIP calls or voice command/prompt interaction with the computer.) The SCO link connection may be set up prior to receiving the AT+CKPD=200 command. If this is not the case, then the SCO link connection shall be set up after receiving the AT+CKPD=200 command.', 'Audio Connection Release Upon user initiated action HS shall send AT+CKPD=200 command to AG. The AG may release the Audio connection (SCO) upon an internal event in the AG or after the AG receives an indication of a user initiated action (e.g. button press) from the AG or HS. The HS may initiate an Audio connection (SCO) release in circumstances such as power-down event while an Audio connection (SCO) is established. Irrespective of the initiating side, the AG is responsible for releasing the profile’s serial port (RFCOMM) connection (see 4.9.1.2).', 'Audio Connection Transfer from AG to HS The audio connection transfer from AG to HS is initiated by a user action on the HS side. To effect this transfer, the HS shall send the AT+CKPD=200 command to the AG.', 'Audio Connection Transfer from HS to AG The audio connection transfer from HS to AG is initiated by a user action on the AG. This user action shall result in the AG releasing the SCO connection.', 'Remote Audio Volume Control The AG can control the gain of the microphone or speaker of the HS by sending unsolicited result codes +VGM or +VGS respectively. There is no restriction on the number or order of these result codes. Support for remote audio volume control is optional, so an implementation may support none, either, or both of the controls for microphone volume and speaker volume. Both the peaker and microphone gain are represented as parameter to the +VGS and +VGM, on a scale from 0 to 15. The values are absolute values, relating to a particular (implementation-dependent) volume level controlled by the HS. The HS may store the VGS and VGM settings at connection release. At connection establishment, the HS may restore the previous settings using the AT commands AT+VGS and AT+VGM. In case physical mechanisms (buttons, dials etc.) means are implemented on the HS to control the volume levels, the HS shall also use the AT commands AT+VGS and AT+VGM to inform the AG of any changes in the volume levels.', 'To verify that the AG can establish a complete audio connection towards the HS.

Notes: The information displayed for each source may include source bar code number, source ID, current owner, and current location, depending on whether it is currently checked out or not.  A quick way for the Custodian to browse sources without affecting the leak test recording process should be provided.\\n3 – A running total must be displayed on the screen of sources that need to be leak tested, sources already leak tested, and sources that are unexpected (found at a location other than the current location logged in the database).\\n4 – The Custodian must enter the bar code of the source being updated using the barcode scanner.  The leak test date for that source should be entered by the Custodian and the leak test date information must be updated in the database.  \\n5 – The Custodian must have the option to also confirm the inventory of a source when the leak testing is recorded.  If the Custodian chooses to confirm the inventory at the same time, the inventory date for that source must be also be updated as leak testing is recorded.\\n6 – If the source is found in an unexpected location, a message must be displayed stating the expected location (the current location logged in the database).\\n7 – If the Custodian quits recording sources before the chosen sources are all recorded, a message must be displayed warning the Custodian that the leak testing is not complete.\\n8 – When the Custodian has finished recording sources, a summarized list of sources just recorded must be sent to the Custodian in an email message.  If a source is found in an unexpected location, it must be included in the summarized list.  If there are any selected sources still needing leak testing, they must also be included in the summarized list.   If the Custodian cancels the leak test recording process, the summarized list of sources must be displayed.  Notes: The summary information is displayed upon cancellation because the email message may not be sent.  The database is updated for all leak tested sources regardless of an email notification being sent or not.  ', ' 1 – If leak testing is past due, there must be a warning message displayed indicating that the leak testing is out of date.  The source may still be transferred if the leak testing is out of date. ', ' 1 – The backup file names must include the date.  Note: this is needed so that it is obvious when the backup was made.\\n2 – If a system outage or error prevents a backup from being performed at its regularly scheduled interval, an email regarding backup failure should be mailed to the System Administrator.', ' 1 – The Custodian must enter his/her Z number using the barcode scanner and must be an authorized Nuclear Material Custodian.\\n2 – The Custodian must be given the option to add, edit or delete a source.\\n3 – The Custodian must enter the data using the touchscreen and barcode scanner.  This includes bar code, source ID, isotope (must be able to have multiple isotopes), enrichment, activity (with units in a pull-down menu), mass (with units in a pull-down menu),  RSSDMS number, MASS source, exempt source, dose rate, description,  U attractiveness level, Pu attractiveness level.  \\n4 – The software shall allow photos of the source and certificates of repackaging to be entered into the database.  When source information is displayed, the option to display these photos will be available.\\n', ' 1 – The Custodian must enter his/her Z number using the barcode scanner and must be an authorized Nuclear Material Custodian.\\n2 – The Custodian must be given the option to add or edit a user record.\\n3 – The Custodian must enter the data using the touchscreen and barcode scanner.  This includes bar code, name, email, group and user roles.']\n",
