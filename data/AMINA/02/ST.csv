ID,Purpose,Test steps
21,Security log,Verify that all relevant information is logged in the security log
23,Log date and system time,Verify that all entries in the log contain the date and system time
32,Send the same info again,Receive same info from file. Receive same info from meter
35,Traceable metering devices,Kamstrup demonstrates how components can be traced to batch and time of manufacture
50,50 simultaneous users,"Run operations with a logged-in user. For example, searches and exports. Measure response times in the web interface. Run the same operations with 50 concurrent users. Measure response times in the web interface."
63,Lifetime Cat1,A Metering Unit shall have a life expectancy of 15 years from the date of delivery to GE.
71,Grid snapshot - Default values,Provoke an overvoltage on one of the meter's phases and verify that events are sent instantaneously to HES. Verify that the correct register (OBIS codes) is associated with the event. Verify that the Optical Eye shows the grid snapshot for the power misdirection event. Verify that the Optical Eye shows the grid snapshot for the voltage rise event
90,Content of the test report,"The test report shall contain at least:
-Test cases executed 
-Results of the tests 
-Residual errors, if any 
-Residual test cases, if any 
-Suggested actions"
188,Exporting reports and data,"Verify that the retrieved measurement and structural data as well as the finished reports can be exported to any standardized text file format, such as csv."
216,Time interval for measured values,Verify that there is functionality to select different time intervals and time resolution for the Metrics presented.
220,Recording of measurement value,"Verify that the measured value recorded and stored in the HES is uncorrupted, i.e. exactly the same value as recorded by the Metering Unit.
Request a timestamped measurement value from the Meter and compare what is displayed on the Meter with the information coming into the HES."
256,Time stamp for measurement value,Verify that all metrics (PQ) are time-stamped with the Current time when received by HES. Verify that all metrics (energy) are time-stamped with the Current time when received by HES.
260,Selecting dates with calendar function,"Verify that where there is a need to select dates in HES, this is done through a time and calendar function."
273,Request further confirmation,"Verify that commands, initiated by the User in HES, which may have serious consequences in case of incorrect handling (deletion of stored measurement and structure data and switching off and on of power) require additional confirmation before being executed. Verify that commands which do not have serious consequences do not require additional confirmation before being executed."
274,Mass deletion,Verify that in HES there is a function to perform mass deletion of overall structure data objects so that all linked relations are also deleted. E.g. that this is implemented via group membership.
319,Record communication errors,"Verify that the Metering System is able to record and store information when the following Events occur:
8. communication failure"
331,Configure records to be stored for events,Verify that for each Event it is possible to optionally configure which registers (OBIS codes) in the Metering Unit should be stored.
348,Status of the customer interface,Verify that in HES it is possible to see if the Customer Interface in a Metering Unit is enabled or disabled for data sending.
358,Response times in the user interface,"Verify that HES user interface response times do not exceed:
- 0.5 s from input, keystroke or equivalent to first response on screen
- 0.5 s for display of form view including data
- 5 s for viewing simple report
- 15 s for login"
364,PQ values to HES within 4h,Verify that the PQ values (15-minute values) can be delivered at the latest within 4 hours from the registration in the Metering Units to HES
414,type approval - Cat1,"Verify that the Extended Type Approval and Certification of Metering Units is carried out according to method SPM 1618, test with 12 kV surge voltage."
415,type approval - Cat2,"Verify that the Extended Type Approval and Certification of Metering Units is carried out according to method SPM 1618, test with 12 kV surge voltage."
451,Location of the marking - Cat1,"Verify that the Meter's serial number is placed on a non-removable part (not connector cover, not Communication Module cover, etc.)."
452,Location of the label - Cat2,"Verify that the Meter's serial number is placed on a non-removable part (not connector cover, not Communication Module cover, etc.)."
465,screw anchors - Cat2,Verify that there are no elevations around the Metering Unit's screw attachments that limit the size of the screw head.
466,screw anchors - Cat1,Verify that there are no elevations around the Metering Unit's screw attachments that limit the size of the screw head.
483,Quantity of allowed faulty meters Cat1 - RISE,"During the expected lifetime of the Metering Units, the occurrence of faults (requiring meter replacement) shall not exceed 0.75 % per year of the installed volume."
484,Amount of allowed faulty meters Cat2 - RISE,"During the expected lifetime of the Metering Units, the occurrence of faults (requiring meter replacement) shall not exceed 0.75 % per year of the installed volume."
485,Lifetime Cat2,A Metering Unit shall have a life expectancy of 15 years from the date of delivery to GE.
491,Design of the solution,Review installed solution and compare with requirements in 2.1 Technical solution.
596,logging of events,Verify in HES that the events and their attribute values can be displayed in an event list.
