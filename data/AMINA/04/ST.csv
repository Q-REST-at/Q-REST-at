Disconnect the power on several phases. Connect production to the meter, and the measuring point in HES has a profile for consumption only. Unscrew a voltage fuse on the meter board so that an event is generated in the meter. Unscrew the 'zero' so that an event is generated in the meter. Use super magnet at the meter to cause an event in the meter. Set a low limit value in the meter. For both cat 1 and cat 2 - generate high current at meter to cause event. For both cat 1 and cat 2 - generate high power on meter to cause event. Generate overheating"
