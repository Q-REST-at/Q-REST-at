S172,Status of switches to other GE system,The HES shall be able to send information to other facility systems if a Metering Unit's circuit breaker is switched on or off.
S177,Interpolation in HES,There should be functionality in HES to perform interpolations where the collected value is missing.
S231,Encryption keys,The metering system shall be able to manage and administer the encryption keys of the metering units.
S237,Logging unique identity,The unique identity of the subject shall be recorded for each logged record.
S259,Dependencies with other systems,Solution design should be such that dependencies on other systems do not cause the system to lose protection.
B31,Record when power output exceeds limit value,"The metering system shall record and store information when the following Events occur:
15. Total power consumption exceeds the set limit value"
B33,Register overheating in connection,"The metering system shall record and store information when the following Events occur:
17. In case of a overheating in connection"
B42,Communication status,"It shall be possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
B62,Energy values to other system within 10 sec,The energy values (15-minute values) shall be exportable from HES via integrations to other systems within 10 seconds after registration in HES.
B71,Help function,The HES user interface shall (LB71) include a help function to assist the User in understanding how to perform tasks using the functionality of the system.
B85,View last measurement value and time,The last Metric and the time of communication with the Metering Unit shall be displayed in the HES.
B105,Database hosting,The HES database must be able to be hosted in the Contracting Authority's database hosting facility.
B113,Synchronization with GE controlled NTP,The metering system and surrounding infrastructure located within GE's network shall be synchronized with GE controlled NTP.
