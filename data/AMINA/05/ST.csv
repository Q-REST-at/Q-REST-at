-install,
-if applicable configure/parameterize,
-if applicable migrate structure data,
-commission,
-verify and test the Metering System including integrations in the production environment, and 
-perform error corrections and retests"
194,Energy values to other system within 10 sec,Verify that the goods are delivered from HES according to the agreed export interval
218,Help function,Verify that there is a help function in the HES user interface that helps the User to understand how to perform tasks using the functionality of the system.
219,Setting the number of decimal places,Verify that it is possible to configure the number of decimal places to be displayed for a measurement value.
238,View last measurement value and time,Verify that the last Measured Value and the time of communication with the Metering Unit are displayed in HES. Verify that the last Measured Value and the time of communication with the Metering Unit are displayed in the HES.
263,Calendar in Swedish format,"Verify that the HES calendar is displayed in Swedish format (YYYY-MM-DD, Y=year, M=month, D=day)"
328,Record when power output exceeds limit value,"Verify that the Metering System is able to record and store information when the following Events occur:
15. Total power consumption exceeds set limit value"
330,Register overheating in connection,"Verify that the Metering System is able to record and store information when the following Events occur:
17. In case of connection overheating"
339,Communication status - Cat1 1 phase,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
340,Communication status - Cat1 3 phase,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
341,Communication status - Cat2,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
352,Interpolation in HES,Verify that there is functionality in HES to perform interpolations where the collected value is missing.
364,PQ values to HES within 4h,Verify that the PQ values (15-minute values) can be delivered at the latest within 4 hours from the registration in the Metering Units to HES
441,Visible manufacturing number - communication module - Cat1,Verify that a serial number on a Communication Module is positioned so that it is not visible on the front of the Metering Unit.
442,Visible manufacturing number - communication module - Cat2,Verify that a serial number on a Communication Module is positioned so that it is not visible on the front of the Metering Unit.
447,Legible marking - Cat1,"Verify that the marking of the meter's manufacturing number is clearly legible
- i.e. the font size must not be too small so that the number is difficult to read e.g. for a customer"
448,Legible marking - Cat2,"Verify that the marking of the meter's manufacturing number is clearly legible
- i.e. the font size must not be too small so that the number is difficult to read e.g. for a customer"
596,logging of events,Verify in HES that the events and their attribute values can be displayed in an event list.
615,Setting the number of decimal places,Verify that the number of decimal places displayed corresponds to the number of decimal places configured to be displayed for a measurement value.
