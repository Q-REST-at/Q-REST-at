ID,Feature,Description
S28,Lifespan,A metering Unit shall have a life expectancy of 15 years from the date of delivery to GE.
S30,Quantity of faulty meters allowed,"Over the expected lifetime of the Metering Units, the occurrence of failures (requiring meter replacement) shall not exceed 0.75 % per year of the installed volume."
S58,Cumulative calculator,The metering unit shall be equipped with a cumulative counter and display at least 7 integer digits and 3 decimal digits.
S60,Correct meter setting,"The meter reading on the Metering Unit shall always match the numerical capacity of the collected Energy Value and the display, even in the event of a rollover."
S73,Legible labeling,"The marking of the meter's production number must be clearly legible
- i.e. the font size must not be too small so that the number becomes difficult to read, e.g. for a customer"
S81,Plinth cap,The metering unit shall have a terminal cover that covers the connection cable layer.
S94,Automatic collection of Measured values,The Metering system shall be configurable for regular automatic collection of Metric Values from Metering Units to HES.
S116,Scaling of environment,HES shall be scalable so that the required performance can be maintained with increased data volumes.
S117,50 simultaneous users,The HES in the production environment shall be designed for at least 50 simultaneous Users without affecting the performance of the Metering System.
S119,Energy values are exported within 30 sec,The energy values (15-minute values) shall be exportable from HES via integrations to other systems within 30 seconds after registration in HES
S135,Time interval for metric values,There shall be functionality to select different time intervals and time resolution for the Metrics presented.
S139,Events to alert list,Events configured to generate Alarms shall be displayed in an Alarm List.
S172,Status of switches to other GE system,The HES shall be able to send information to other facility systems if a Metering Unit's circuit breaker is switched on or off.
S174,Status of the customer interface,"In HES, it shall be possible to see whether the Customer Interface in a Metering Unit is enabled or disabled for data sending."
S192,Licensed telecommunications networks,"If the communication solution includes licensed telecommunications networks, it must comply with Ordinances and Regulations in accordance with PTSFS 2015:2 issued by PTS (Swedish Post and Telecom Authority)."
S236,Log date and system time,The date and system time shall be recorded for each logged record.
B15,Measurement and recording / phase,"The metering unit shall be able to measure and record for each phase the minimum, maximum and average value of voltage, current, active and reactive power of the electricity output and input per 5 minutes."
B34,Configure records to be stored for events,"For each Event, it shall be possible to optionally configure which registers (OBIS codes) in the Metering Unit are to be stored."
B35,Disable sending of Events from specific Metering Unit,It shall be possible to disable the sending of Events from the designated Metering Unit from HES in order not to have to receive a large amount of Events from a particular Metering Unit.
B46,mounting bracket,There shall be a mounting bracket placed on the top of the metering unit for mounting.
B73,Filtering and sorting in alarm list,A User shall have the possibility to filter and sort the alarm list.
B85,View last measurement value and time,The last Metric and the time of communication with the Metering Unit shall be displayed in the HES.
B87,copy static fields,"It shall be possible for the User to be able to copy static fields in HES such as headers, status, responses to Events in the system."
B91,Configuring the Metering Unit,Configuration of the Metering Device from HES shall be possible without downloading new Firmware.
S560,Requirements for delivery and installation in the production environment,"During installation and commissioning of the Metering System in the Customer's production environment, the Supplier shall: 
-install, 
-if necessary configure/parameterize, 
-if necessary migrate structural data, 
-commission, 
-verify and test the Metering System including integrations in the production environment, and 
-perform error corrections and retests"
