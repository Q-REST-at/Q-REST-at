101,Requirements for delivery and installation in the production environment,"The Supplier shall during installation and commissioning of the Metering System in the Customer's production environment:
-install,
-if applicable configure/parameterize,
-if applicable migrate structure data,
-commission,
-verify and test the Metering System including integrations in the production environment, and 
-perform error corrections and retests"
149,Automatic collection of Measured values,Verify that the metering system can be configured for regular automatic collection of Measurement values from Metering Units to HES.
216,Time interval for measured values,Verify that there is functionality to select different time intervals and time resolution for the Metrics presented.
222,Events to alert list,"Reset the clock in the meter. Trigger self-diagnosis and generate a fault during the diagnosis itself. Disconnect the power on one phase. Disconnect the power on several phases. Connect production to the meter, and the measuring point in HES has a profile for consumption only. Unscrew a voltage fuse on the meter board so that an event is generated in the meter. Unscrew the 'zero' so that an event is generated in the meter. Use super magnet at the meter to cause an event in the meter. Set a low limit value in the meter. For both cat 1 and cat 2 - generate high current at meter to cause event. For both cat 1 and cat 2 - generate high power on meter to cause event. Generate overheating"
224,Filtering and sorting in alarm list,Verify that a User has the ability to filter and sort in the alarm list.
238,View last measurement value and time,Verify that the last Measured Value and the time of communication with the Metering Unit are displayed in HES. Verify that the last Measured Value and the time of communication with the Metering Unit are displayed in the HES.
247,Cumulative calculator,Verify that the metering unit is equipped with a cumulative counter and displays at least 7 integer digits and 3 decimal digits.
251,Correct meter setting,"Verify that the Meter Reading on the Metering Unit always matches the numerical capacity of the collected Energy Value and the display, even if the Meter Readings have rolled over."
271,copy static fields,"Verify that it is possible to copy static fields in HES such as headers, status, responses to Events in the system."
279,Configuring the Metering Unit,Verify that configuration of the Metering Device from HES can be performed without downloading new Firmware.
310,Measurement and recording / phase,"Verify that the Metering Unit for each phase is able to measure and record the minimum, maximum and average value of voltage, current, active and reactive power of the electricity output and input per 5 minutes."
331,Configure records to be stored for events,Verify that for each Event it is possible to optionally configure which registers (OBIS codes) in the Metering Unit should be stored.
332,Disable sending of Events from specific Metering Unit,Verify that it is possible to disable the sending of Events from the designated Metering Unit from HES in order not to have to receive a large amount of Events from a particular Metering Unit.
348,Status of the customer interface,Verify that in HES it is possible to see if the Customer Interface in a Metering Unit is enabled or disabled for data sending.
447,Legible marking - Cat1,"Verify that the marking of the meter's manufacturing number is clearly legible
- i.e. the font size must not be too small so that the number is difficult to read e.g. for a customer"
448,Legible marking - Cat2,"Verify that the marking of the meter's manufacturing number is clearly legible
- i.e. the font size must not be too small so that the number is difficult to read e.g. for a customer"
463,Terminal block - Cat1,Verify that the Metering Unit has terminal covers that cover the connection cable layer.
464,Terminal block - Cat2,Verify that the Metering Unit has terminal covers that cover the connection cable layer.
467,mounting bracket - Cat1,Verify that there is a mounting bracket placed on the top of the metering unit for mounting.
468,mounting bracket - Cat2,Verify that there is a mounting bracket placed on the top of the metering unit for mounting.
479,Licensed telecommunications networks,Verify that the licensed telecommunications network complies with Ordinances and Regulations in accordance with PTSFS 2015:2 issued by PTS (Post- och Telestyrelsen).
483,Quantity of allowed faulty meters Cat1 - RISE,"During the expected lifetime of the Metering Units, the occurrence of faults (requiring meter replacement) shall not exceed 0.75 % per year of the installed volume."
484,Amount of allowed faulty meters Cat2 - RISE,"During the expected lifetime of the Metering Units, the occurrence of faults (requiring meter replacement) shall not exceed 0.75 % per year of the installed volume."
485,Lifetime Cat2,A Metering Unit shall have a life expectancy of 15 years from the date of delivery to GE.
