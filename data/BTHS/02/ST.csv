ID,Purpose,Test steps
HSP/AG/IAC/BV-01-I,To verify that the AG can establish a complete audio connection towards the HS.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- HS is in Standby mode, no connection to AG
- AG is in Standby mode, no active call and no connection to HS
- Configure the AG to pass an incoming call/audio connection to the HS.

Procedure: 
AG: Initiate a call/audio connection to the AG from a test device.
HS: The HS or AG might be alerted. In that case establish the connection by the corresponding user action (e.g. press button) at the HS

Expected Outcome AG: A call/audio connection is established"
HSP/HS/IAC/BV-01-I,To verify that the HS accepts a complete connection establishment initiated from the AG.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- HS is in Standby mode, no connection to AG
- AG is in Standby mode, no active call and no connection to HS
- Configure the AG to pass an incoming call/audio connection to the HS.

Procedure: 
AG: Initiate a call/audio connection to the AG from a test device.
HS: The HS or AG might be alerted. In that case establish the connection by the corresponding user action (e.g. press button) at the HS

Expected Outcome HS: 
- If an alert is provided the followed user action on the HS establishes the call/audio connection and bi-directional conversation or any other intended audio application is possible. 
- If no alert is provided the call/audio connection is established without any further user action and bi-directional conversation or any other intended audio application is possible. 
- In the case where the AG has opened a SCO connection with in-band ring tone before sending the RING command, the HS may provide no other alert besides the playback of in-band ring. User action on the HS establishes the call/audio connection and bi-directional conversation or any other intended audio application is possible."
