4.6.1,Audio Connection Transfer from AG to HS,"The audio connection transfer from AG to HS is initiated by a user action on the HS side. To effect this transfer, the HS shall send the AT+CKPD=200 command to the AG."
4.6.2,Audio Connection Transfer from HS to AG,The audio connection transfer from HS to AG is initiated by a user action on the AG. This user action shall result in the AG releasing the SCO connection.
4.7,Remote Audio Volume Control,"The AG can control the gain of the microphone or speaker of the HS by sending unsolicited result codes +VGM or +VGS respectively. There is no restriction on the number or order of these result codes. Support for remote audio volume control is optional, so an implementation may support none, either, or both of the controls for microphone volume and speaker volume. Both the peaker and microphone gain are represented as parameter to the +VGS and +VGM, on a scale from 0 to 15. The values are absolute values, relating to a particular (implementation-dependent) volume level controlled by the HS. The HS may store the VGS and VGM settings at connection release. At connection establishment, the HS may restore the previous settings using the AT commands AT+VGS and AT+VGM. In case physical mechanisms (buttons, dials etc.) means are implemented on the HS to control the volume levels, the HS shall also use the AT commands AT+VGS and AT+VGM to inform the AG of any changes in the volume levels."
