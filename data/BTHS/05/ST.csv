HSP/AG/ACT/BV-01-I,"To verify that the AG can perform an audio connection transfer from AG to HS initiated by a user
action on the headset.","Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- HS is in Standby mode, no connection to AG
- For AG a call/audio connection is active at the AG.

Procedure: 
HS: Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the HS to transfer the audio connection from AG to HS
AG:No user action is required
  
Expected Outcome AG:The user action on the HS transfers the audio connection from AG to HS"
HSP/AG/ACT/BV-02-I,"To verify that the HS accepts an audio connection transfer from HS to AG initiated by a user
action on the AG.","Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection to AG is ongoing with audio I/O on HS.
- For AG a call/audio connection to HS is ongoing.

Procedure: 
HS:No user action is required
AG: Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the AG to transfer the audio connection from HS to AG.
  
Expected Outcome AG: The user action on the AG transfers the audio connection from HS to AG. The call/audio connection is available at the AG."
HSP/HS/ACT/BV-02-I,To verify the audio connection transfer from HS to AG initiated by a user action on the AG.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection to AG is ongoing with audio I/O on HS.
- For AG a call/audio connection to HS is ongoing.

Procedure: 
HS:No user action is required
AG: Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the AG to transfer the audio connection from HS to AG.
  
Expected Outcome HS: The user action on the AG transfers the audio connection from HS to AG. The HS returns to Standby mode."
HSP/AG/RAV/BV-02-I,To verify the speaker volume control of the headset if remote speaker volume control is supported.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection is active.
- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS).

Procedure: 
HS: No user action is required.
AG: 
- Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the AG to set the speaker volume on the HS to the
maximum level.
- Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the AG to set the speaker volume on the HS to the
minimum level

Expected Outcome HS and AG: The user actions on the HS and AG result in the respective speaker volume settings."
HSP/AG/RAV/BV-03-I,"To verify that if storing the speaker volume settings in the HS is supported the correct settings
are used when establishing a new connection.","Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection is active.
- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS).

Procedure: 
1. Set the volume control to a value significantly different from the nominal volume either by the HS or AG. 
2. Realease the connection either by HS or AG. 
3. Establish a new connection to the HS either by HS or AG. 

Expected Outcome AG: The user may be notified of the restored volume level after establishing the new call/audio connection"

2. Realease the connection either by HS or AG. 
3. Establish a new connection to the HS either by HS or AG. 

Expected Outcome HS: After establishing the new connection the speaker volume is restored to the value which was set before releasing the call/audio connection."
