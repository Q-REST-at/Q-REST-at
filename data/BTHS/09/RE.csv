4.2,Audio Gateway Initiated ACL Connection Establishment,"Upon an internal or user generated event, the AG will initiate connection establishment. There are then two options as described in the  4.2.1 and  4.2.2. The SCO link establishment can take place anytime after the ACL connection establishment."
4.2.1,Using In-Band Ringing,"An in-band ring tone is an audible alert, such as a tone, melody, short music clip, that is transmitted by the AG, to the HS, to alert the user of an event; typically an incoming call. The AG may generate an in-band ring tone using the SCO connection to the HS. The AG decides how to use this SCO connection. When using an in-band ring tone, the AG shall not send the RING unsolicited result code to the HS3.."
4.3,Headset Initiated ACL Connection Establishment,"A headset (HS) originated ACL connection is initiated (see 4.9) by a user action (e.g. pressing a button on the headset). Upon completion of a connection establishment that was initiated by pressing the “headset button”, the HS shall send the AT+CKPD=200 command to the AG. If the HS connection is initiated by an event other than a headset button press, the HS shall not send AT+CKPD=200. The AG may initiate a SCO connection after the completion of the ACL connection establishment, but before receiving the AT+CKPD=200 command from the HS. This may be desirable when the AG is a mobile phone. In all cases, the AG is responsible for establishing the SCO link if needed. Further internal actions may be needed on the AG to internally establish and/or route the audio stream to the HS4. (For a cellular phone a cellular call may need to be established, e.g. using last dialled number or a pre-programmed number. For a personal computer this may relate to VoIP calls or voice command/prompt interaction with the computer.) The SCO link connection may be set up prior to receiving the AT+CKPD=200 command. If this is not the case, then the SCO link connection shall be set up after receiving the AT+CKPD=200 command."
4.5,Audio Connection Release,"Upon user initiated action HS shall send AT+CKPD=200 command to AG. The AG may release the Audio connection (SCO) upon an internal event in the AG or after the AG receives an indication of a user initiated action (e.g. button press) from the AG or HS. The HS may initiate an Audio connection (SCO) release in circumstances such as power-down event while an Audio connection (SCO) is established. Irrespective of the initiating side, the AG is responsible for releasing the profile’s serial port (RFCOMM) connection (see 4.9.1.2)."
