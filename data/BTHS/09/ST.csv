ID,Purpose,Test steps
HSP/AG/IAC/BV-01-I,To verify that the AG can establish a complete audio connection towards the HS.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- HS is in Standby mode, no connection to AG
- AG is in Standby mode, no active call and no connection to HS
- Configure the AG to pass an incoming call/audio connection to the HS.

Procedure: 
AG: Initiate a call/audio connection to the AG from a test device.
HS: The HS or AG might be alerted. In that case establish the connection by the corresponding user action (e.g. press button) at the HS

Expected Outcome AG: A call/audio connection is established"
HSP/HS/IAC/BV-01-I,To verify that the HS accepts a complete connection establishment initiated from the AG.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- HS is in Standby mode, no connection to AG
- AG is in Standby mode, no active call and no connection to HS
- Configure the AG to pass an incoming call/audio connection to the HS.

Procedure: 
AG: Initiate a call/audio connection to the AG from a test device.
HS: The HS or AG might be alerted. In that case establish the connection by the corresponding user action (e.g. press button) at the HS

Expected Outcome HS: 
- If an alert is provided the followed user action on the HS establishes the call/audio connection and bi-directional conversation or any other intended audio application is possible. 
- If no alert is provided the call/audio connection is established without any further user action and bi-directional conversation or any other intended audio application is possible. 
- In the case where the AG has opened a SCO connection with in-band ring tone before sending the RING command, the HS may provide no other alert besides the playback of in-band ring. User action on the HS establishes the call/audio connection and bi-directional conversation or any other intended audio application is possible."
HSP/AG/IAC/BV-02-I,"To verify that, if supported and provided by the AG, the AG can cause the HS to give an in-band
ringing tone during connection establishment initiated from the AG","Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- HS is in Standby mode, no connection to AG
- AG is in Standby mode, no active call and no connection to HS
- The AG is configured to provide an in-band ring tone.

Procedure: 
AG:Initiate a call/audio connection to the AG from a test device.
HS: Upon alerting in the HS earpiece, establish the connection by the corresponding user action (e.g. press button) at the HS.

Expected Outcome AG:
- No RING unsolicited response code is sent by the AG
- A call/audio connection is established"
HSP/HS/IAC/BV-02-I,"To verify that, if supported and provided by the AG, the HS gives an in-band ringing tone during
connection establishment initiated from the AG.","Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- HS is in Standby mode, no connection to AG
- AG is in Standby mode, no active call and no connection to HS
- The AG is configured to provide an in-band ring tone.

Procedure: 
AG:Initiate a call/audio connection to the AG from a test device.
HS: Upon alerting in the HS earpiece, establish the connection by the corresponding user action (e.g. press button) at the HS.

Expected Outcome HS: 
-Upon the call/audio connection initiation to the AG, the HS alerts the user.
- The followed user action on the HS establishes the call/audio connection and bi-directional conversation is possible."
HSP/AG/OAC/BV-01-I,To verify that the AG accepts a complete connection establishment initiated from the HS.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- HS is in Standby mode, no connection to AG
- AG is in Standby mode, no active call and no connection to HS
- The AG has to be prepared for establishing outgoing connections upon user action on the HS (e.g. last dialed or pre-programmed number). The manufacturer must state, which options for determination of the number are implemented. It is sufficient to test with one of these.

Procedure: 
HS: Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the HS to establish an outgoing call/audio connection.
AG: No user action is required.

Expected Outcome AG: A call/audio connection is established"

HSP/AG/ACR/BV-01-I,To verify that the AG accepts a connection release initiated from the headset.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection is active
- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS)

Procedure: 
HS: Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the headset to release the connection.
AG: No user action is required.

Expected Outcome AG: A call/audio connection is established"
HSP/HS/ACR/BV-01-I,To verify a connection release initiated from the headset.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile.

- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS)

Procedure: 
HS: Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the headset to release the connection.
AG: No user action is required.
  
Expected Outcome HS: Upon the user action, the HS shall send AT+CKPD=200 command to the AG."
