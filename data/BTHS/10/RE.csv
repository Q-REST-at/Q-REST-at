4.2.2,Using the RING message,The AG will repeatedly send the RING unsolicited result code to the HS for a time period decided by the AG. The RING may be repeated for as long as the connection establishment is pending.
4.5,Audio Connection Release,"Upon user initiated action HS shall send AT+CKPD=200 command to AG. The AG may release the Audio connection (SCO) upon an internal event in the AG or after the AG receives an indication of a user initiated action (e.g. button press) from the AG or HS. The HS may initiate an Audio connection (SCO) release in circumstances such as power-down event while an Audio connection (SCO) is established. Irrespective of the initiating side, the AG is responsible for releasing the profileâ€™s serial port (RFCOMM) connection (see 4.9.1.2)."
4.7,Remote Audio Volume Control,"The AG can control the gain of the microphone or speaker of the HS by sending unsolicited result codes +VGM or +VGS respectively. There is no restriction on the number or order of these result codes. Support for remote audio volume control is optional, so an implementation may support none, either, or both of the controls for microphone volume and speaker volume. Both the peaker and microphone gain are represented as parameter to the +VGS and +VGM, on a scale from 0 to 15. The values are absolute values, relating to a particular (implementation-dependent) volume level controlled by the HS. The HS may store the VGS and VGM settings at connection release. At connection establishment, the HS may restore the previous settings using the AT commands AT+VGS and AT+VGM. In case physical mechanisms (buttons, dials etc.) means are implemented on the HS to control the volume levels, the HS shall also use the AT commands AT+VGS and AT+VGM to inform the AG of any changes in the volume levels."
