ID,Purpose,Test steps
HSP/AG/ACR/BV-01-I,To verify that the AG accepts a connection release initiated from the headset.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection is active
- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS)

Procedure: 
HS: Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the headset to release the connection.
AG: No user action is required.

Expected Outcome AG: A call/audio connection is established"
HSP/HS/ACR/BV-01-I,To verify a connection release initiated from the headset.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection is active
- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS)

Procedure: 
HS: Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the headset to release the connection.
AG: No user action is required.
  
Expected Outcome HS: Upon the user action, the HS shall send AT+CKPD=200 command to the AG."
HSP/HS/ACR/BV-02-I,To verify that the HS accepts an audio connection release initiated on the AG.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- HS is in Standby mode, no connection to AG
- AG is in Standby mode, no active call and no connection to HS
- The AG has to be prepared for establishing outgoing connections upon user action on the HS (e.g. last dialed or pre-programmed number). The manufacturer must state, which options for determination of the number are implemented. It is sufficient to test with one of these.


Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection is active
- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS)

Procedure: 
HS: No user action is required
AG:Initiate the user action or internal event to release the connection.
  
Expected Outcome HS and AG: The user action on the AG releases the call/audio connection."
HSP/AG/RAV/BV-02-I,To verify the speaker volume control of the headset if remote speaker volume control is supported.,"Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection is active.
- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS).

Procedure: 
HS: No user action is required.
AG: 
- Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the AG to set the speaker volume on the HS to the
maximum level.
- Initiate the user action (e.g. press button) on the AG to set the speaker volume on the HS to the
minimum level

Expected Outcome HS and AG: The user actions on the HS and AG result in the respective speaker volume settings."
HSP/AG/RAV/BV-03-I,"To verify that if storing the speaker volume settings in the HS is supported the correct settings
are used when establishing a new connection.","Initial condition: 
- Both devices are initilized. Ensure HS and AG are initially paired, confirming interoperability for the headset profile. 
- For HS a call/audio connection is active.
- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS).

Procedure: 
1. Set the volume control to a value significantly different from the nominal volume either by the HS or AG. 
2. Realease the connection either by HS or AG. 
3. Establish a new connection to the HS either by HS or AG. 

Expected Outcome AG: The user may be notified of the restored volume level after establishing the new call/audio connection"

- For AG a call/audio connection is active (voice I/O on HS).

Procedure: 
1. Set the volume control to a value significantly different from the nominal volume either by the HS or AG. 
2. Realease the connection either by HS or AG. 
3. Establish a new connection to the HS either by HS or AG. 

Expected Outcome HS: After establishing the new connection the speaker volume is restored to the value which was set before releasing the call/audio connection."
