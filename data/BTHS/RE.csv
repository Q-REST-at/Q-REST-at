4.2,Audio Gateway Initiated ACL Connection Establishment,"Upon an internal or user generated event, the AG will initiate connection establishment. There are then two options as described in the  4.2.1 and  4.2.2. The SCO link establishment can take place anytime after the ACL connection establishment."
4.2.1,Using In-Band Ringing,"An in-band ring tone is an audible alert, such as a tone, melody, short music clip, that is transmitted by the AG, to the HS, to alert the user of an event; typically an incoming call. The AG may generate an in-band ring tone using the SCO connection to the HS. The AG decides how to use this SCO connection. When using an in-band ring tone, the AG shall not send the RING unsolicited result code to the HS3.."
4.2.2,Using the RING message,The AG will repeatedly send the RING unsolicited result code to the HS for a time period decided by the AG. The RING may be repeated for as long as the connection establishment is pending.
4.3,Headset Initiated ACL Connection Establishment,"A headset (HS) originated ACL connection is initiated (see 4.9) by a user action (e.g. pressing a button on the headset). Upon completion of a connection establishment that was initiated by pressing the “headset button”, the HS shall send the AT+CKPD=200 command to the AG. If the HS connection is initiated by an event other than a headset button press, the HS shall not send AT+CKPD=200. The AG may initiate a SCO connection after the completion of the ACL connection establishment, but before receiving the AT+CKPD=200 command from the HS. This may be desirable when the AG is a mobile phone. In all cases, the AG is responsible for establishing the SCO link if needed. Further internal actions may be needed on the AG to internally establish and/or route the audio stream to the HS4. (For a cellular phone a cellular call may need to be established, e.g. using last dialled number or a pre-programmed number. For a personal computer this may relate to VoIP calls or voice command/prompt interaction with the computer.) The SCO link connection may be set up prior to receiving the AT+CKPD=200 command. If this is not the case, then the SCO link connection shall be set up after receiving the AT+CKPD=200 command."
4.5,Audio Connection Release,"Upon user initiated action HS shall send AT+CKPD=200 command to AG. The AG may release the Audio connection (SCO) upon an internal event in the AG or after the AG receives an indication of a user initiated action (e.g. button press) from the AG or HS. The HS may initiate an Audio connection (SCO) release in circumstances such as power-down event while an Audio connection (SCO) is established. Irrespective of the initiating side, the AG is responsible for releasing the profile’s serial port (RFCOMM) connection (see 4.9.1.2)."
4.6.1,Audio Connection Transfer from AG to HS,"The audio connection transfer from AG to HS is initiated by a user action on the HS side. To effect this transfer, the HS shall send the AT+CKPD=200 command to the AG."
4.6.2,Audio Connection Transfer from HS to AG,The audio connection transfer from HS to AG is initiated by a user action on the AG. This user action shall result in the AG releasing the SCO connection.
4.7,Remote Audio Volume Control,"The AG can control the gain of the microphone or speaker of the HS by sending unsolicited result codes +VGM or +VGS respectively. There is no restriction on the number or order of these result codes. Support for remote audio volume control is optional, so an implementation may support none, either, or both of the controls for microphone volume and speaker volume. Both the peaker and microphone gain are represented as parameter to the +VGS and +VGM, on a scale from 0 to 15. The values are absolute values, relating to a particular (implementation-dependent) volume level controlled by the HS. The HS may store the VGS and VGM settings at connection release. At connection establishment, the HS may restore the previous settings using the AT commands AT+VGS and AT+VGM. In case physical mechanisms (buttons, dials etc.) means are implemented on the HS to control the volume levels, the HS shall also use the AT commands AT+VGS and AT+VGM to inform the AG of any changes in the volume levels."
