T-7,"Purpose
This basic testcase is designed to verify that folders are properly
  created and inserted into the bookmarks hierarchy.","Initial Conditions
You must have a bookmarks file. To promote consistency, you may choose to use the default set of Netscape Seamonkey Bookmarks , which
    I use. I have also provided the default Mozilla bookmarks file. You also have the option to use this very large bookmarks file . You must also customize your sidebar to include a bookmarks panel.

Steps/Description
Select Bookmarks|Manage Bookmarks. Select any item in your list. Select File|New Folder. Click ""OK"" in the
    dialog that appears. Select the folder you just created. Select File|New Folder. Click ""OK""
    in the dialog that appears. Double-click the folder you just created. Select File|New Folder. Click
    ""OK"" in the dialog that appears.

Expected Results
For step (2) a folder named ""New Folder"" should have been created and
    added just below the item you had selected. That item could be a bookmark,
    a folder, or a separator. For step (3) the folder should have again been created below the item
    (New Folder). In step (4) however, the folder should be created inside the previous folder. All of the newly created folders should appear with the correct
    hierarchical structure in the toplevel bookmarks menu, the bookmarks popup
    on the personal toolbar, the bookmarks panel in the sidebar, and of course
    the manage bookmarks window."

This basic testcase is designed to verify that bookmarks and folders can't

    use. I have also provided the default Mozilla bookmarks file. You also have the option to use this very large bookmarks file . You must also customize your sidebar to include a bookmarks panel. As part of your bookmarks file you need a folder (lets' call it folder

    ""A 1 "" (read Asub1)) that contains bookmarks as well.

Steps/Description
Select Bookmarks|Manage Bookmarks. Select folder A 1 then drag&drop it onto or within
    itself Select folder A 1 then drag&drop it onto or within folder
    A. Select folder A then drag&drop it onto or within folder
