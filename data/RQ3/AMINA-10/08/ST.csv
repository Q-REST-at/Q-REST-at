ID,Purpose,Test steps
10,Database hosting,Verify that the system documentation describes the databases and database versions used.
149,Automatic collection of Measured values,Verify that the metering system can be configured for regular automatic collection of Measurement values from Metering Units to HES.
247,Cumulative calculator,Verify that the metering unit is equipped with a cumulative counter and displays at least 7 integer digits and 3 decimal digits.
273,Request further confirmation,"Verify that commands, initiated by the User in HES, which may have serious consequences in case of incorrect handling (deletion of stored measurement and structure data and switching off and on of power) require additional confirmation before being executed. Verify that commands which do not have serious consequences do not require additional confirmation before being executed."
302,Possible overheating - Cat1 1 phase,Verify that the metering device has the capability to detect connections that may cause overheating.
303,Possible overheating - Cat1 3 phase,Verify that the metering device has the capability to detect connections that may cause overheating.
304,Possible overheating - Cat2,Verify that the metering device has the capability to detect connections that may cause overheating.
328,Record when power output exceeds limit value,"Verify that the Metering System is able to record and store information when the following Events occur:
15. Total power consumption exceeds set limit value"
332,Disable sending of Events from specific Metering Unit,Verify that it is possible to disable the sending of Events from the designated Metering Unit from HES in order not to have to receive a large amount of Events from a particular Metering Unit.
404,View meters with communication problems in map,Verify that in HES it is possible to visualize Metering Units with communication problems in a graphical view/map that can be zoomed in and out.
447,Legible marking - Cat1,"Verify that the marking of the meter's manufacturing number is clearly legible
- i.e. the font size must not be too small so that the number is difficult to read e.g. for a customer"
448,Legible marking - Cat2,"Verify that the marking of the meter's manufacturing number is clearly legible
- i.e. the font size must not be too small so that the number is difficult to read e.g. for a customer"
463,Terminal block - Cat1,Verify that the Metering Unit has terminal covers that cover the connection cable layer.
464,Terminal block - Cat2,Verify that the Metering Unit has terminal covers that cover the connection cable layer.
