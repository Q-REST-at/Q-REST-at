ID,Purpose,Test steps
21,Security log,Verify that all relevant information is logged in the security log
26,Synchronization with GE controlled NTP,Set wrong time in meter. Synchronize meter with system. Check that server web01 has setting to synchronize time with time server.
35,Traceable metering devices,Kamstrup demonstrates how components can be traced to batch and time of manufacture
71,Grid snapshot - Default values,Provoke an overvoltage on one of the meter's phases and verify that events are sent instantaneously to HES. Verify that the correct register (OBIS codes) is associated with the event. Verify that the Optical Eye shows the grid snapshot for the power misdirection event. Verify that the Optical Eye shows the grid snapshot for the voltage rise event
98,Scope of UAT,The purchaser's UAT (User Acceptance Test) shall include testing and verification of all requirements of the Specification unless otherwise agreed.
194,Energy values to other system within 10 sec,Verify that the goods are delivered from HES according to the agreed export interval
247,Cumulative calculator,Verify that the metering unit is equipped with a cumulative counter and displays at least 7 integer digits and 3 decimal digits.
248,Metering unit display - Cat1 1 phase,Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of voltage. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of current. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of power for the extraction and input of electricity.
249,Metering unit display - Cat1 3 phase,Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of voltage. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of current. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of power for the extraction and input of electricity.
250,Metering unit display - Cat2,Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of voltage. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of current. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of power for the extraction and input of electricity.
404,View meters with communication problems in map,Verify that in HES it is possible to visualize Metering Units with communication problems in a graphical view/map that can be zoomed in and out.
465,screw anchors - Cat2,Verify that there are no elevations around the Metering Unit's screw attachments that limit the size of the screw head.
466,screw anchors - Cat1,Verify that there are no elevations around the Metering Unit's screw attachments that limit the size of the screw head.
