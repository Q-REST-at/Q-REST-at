ID,Purpose,Test steps
50,50 simultaneous users,"Run operations with a logged-in user. For example, searches and exports. Measure response times in the web interface. Run the same operations with 50 concurrent users. Measure response times in the web interface."
143,Data in HES,"Verify that structure data can be handled in HES (e.g. Facility ID, Metering Unit). Verify that Metrics can be handled in HES (Metrics with e.g. ID number, status, timestamp). Verify that Events can be handled in HES (Event with e.g. Event ID, times, Alarms)"
224,Filtering and sorting in alarm list,Verify that a User has the ability to filter and sort in the alarm list.
245,Customer interface is disabled by default,"Verify that on delivery from the factory, the Customer Interface of the Metering Unit is deactivated."
248,Metering unit display - Cat1 1 phase,Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of voltage. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of current. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of power for the extraction and input of electricity.
249,Metering unit display - Cat1 3 phase,Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of voltage. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of current.

250,Metering unit display - Cat2,Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of voltage. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of current. Verify that the display of the Metering Unit for each phase can show the instantaneous value of power for the extraction and input of electricity.
273,Request further confirmation,"Verify that commands, initiated by the User in HES, which may have serious consequences in case of incorrect handling (deletion of stored measurement and structure data and switching off and on of power) require additional confirmation before being executed. Verify that commands which do not have serious consequences do not require additional confirmation before being executed."
328,Record when power output exceeds limit value,"Verify that the Metering System is able to record and store information when the following Events occur:
15. Total power consumption exceeds set limit value"

340,Communication status - Cat1 3 phase,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
341,Communication status - Cat2,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
358,Response times in the user interface,"Verify that HES user interface response times do not exceed:
- 0.5 s from input, keystroke or equivalent to first response on screen
- 0.5 s for display of form view including data
- 5 s for viewing simple report
- 15 s for login"
467,mounting bracket - Cat1,Verify that there is a mounting bracket placed on the top of the metering unit for mounting.
