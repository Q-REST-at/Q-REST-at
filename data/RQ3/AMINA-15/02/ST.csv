ID,Purpose,Test steps
20,Encryption keys,Verify that the solution description details how encryption keys are managed
98,Scope of UAT,The purchaser's UAT (User Acceptance Test) shall include testing and verification of all requirements of the Specification unless otherwise agreed.
224,Filtering and sorting in alarm list,Verify that a User has the ability to filter and sort in the alarm list.
245,Customer interface is disabled by default,"Verify that on delivery from the factory, the Customer Interface of the Metering Unit is deactivated."
256,Time stamp for measurement value,Verify that all metrics (PQ) are time-stamped with the Current time when received by HES. Verify that all metrics (energy) are time-stamped with the Current time when received by HES.
260,Selecting dates with calendar function,"Verify that where there is a need to select dates in HES, this is done through a time and calendar function."
273,Request further confirmation,"Verify that commands, initiated by the User in HES, which may have serious consequences in case of incorrect handling (deletion of stored measurement and structure data and switching off and on of power) require additional confirmation before being executed. Verify that commands which do not have serious consequences do not require additional confirmation before being executed."
279,Configuring the Metering Unit,Verify that configuration of the Metering Device from HES can be performed without downloading new Firmware.
331,Configure records to be stored for events,Verify that for each Event it is possible to optionally configure which registers (OBIS codes) in the Metering Unit should be stored.
360,Block switches from HES,"For Cat1 - 1 phase meters, verify that the Meter breaker can be blocked from HES to prevent local connection. For Cat1 - 3 phase meters, verify that the Meter breaker can be blocked from HES to prevent local connection. For Cat2 meters, verify that the Meter breaker cannot be blocked from HES to prevent local connection."
414,type approval - Cat1,"Verify that the Extended Type Approval and Certification of Metering Units is carried out according to method SPM 1618, test with 12 kV surge voltage."
415,type approval - Cat2,"Verify that the Extended Type Approval and Certification of Metering Units is carried out according to method SPM 1618, test with 12 kV surge voltage."
430,Management of both primary and secondary registration - Cat2,Verify that the Metering Units can handle primary registration of Measured Values. Verify that the Metering Units can handle secondary registration of Measured Values.
463,Terminal block - Cat1,Verify that the Metering Unit has terminal covers that cover the connection cable layer.
464,Terminal block - Cat2,Verify that the Metering Unit has terminal covers that cover the connection cable layer.
478,Management of both primary and secondary registration - Cat1,Verify that the Metering Units can handle both primary and secondary recording of Metering Values.
480,Life expectancy of communication equipment - Cat1,Verify that communication equipment meets the life expectancy requirement of >=15 years from the date of delivery to GE.
486,Life expectancy of communication equipment - Cat2,Verify that communication equipment meets the life expectancy requirement of >=15 years from the date of delivery to GE.
