ID,Purpose,Test steps
63,Lifetime Cat1,A Metering Unit shall have a life expectancy of 15 years from the date of delivery to GE.
216,Time interval for measured values,Verify that there is functionality to select different time intervals and time resolution for the Metrics presented.
218,Help function,Verify that there is a help function in the HES user interface that helps the User to understand how to perform tasks using the functionality of the system.
220,Recording of measurement value,"Verify that the measured value recorded and stored in the HES is uncorrupted, i.e. exactly the same value as recorded by the Metering Unit.
Request a timestamped measurement value from the Meter and compare what is displayed on the Meter with the information coming into the HES."
260,Selecting dates with calendar function,"Verify that where there is a need to select dates in HES, this is done through a time and calendar function."
339,Communication status - Cat1 1 phase,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
340,Communication status - Cat1 3 phase,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
341,Communication status - Cat2,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
364,PQ values to HES within 4h,Verify that the PQ values (15-minute values) can be delivered at the latest within 4 hours from the registration in the Metering Units to HES
406,Legal requirements,"Kamstrup shows how they fulfill:

11. EU Regulation 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation).
12. EU Declaration of Conformity shall be provided for the Metering System if it or parts thereof are manufactured in a country outside the EU.
13. Law (2003:389) on electronic communication."
430,Management of both primary and secondary registration - Cat2,Verify that the Metering Units can handle primary registration of Measured Values. Verify that the Metering Units can handle secondary registration of Measured Values.
432,Cat 2 shall meet the requirements for control,"Verify that Metering Units Category 2 meet the requirements for Inspection, according to Regulation STAFS 2009:8, for the first Inspection. However, only for a maximum of 12 years after Final Approval has been given by the Client."
441,Visible manufacturing number - communication module - Cat1,Verify that a serial number on a Communication Module is positioned so that it is not visible on the front of the Metering Unit.
442,Visible manufacturing number - communication module - Cat2,Verify that a serial number on a Communication Module is positioned so that it is not visible on the front of the Metering Unit.
447,Legible marking - Cat1,"Verify that the marking of the meter's manufacturing number is clearly legible
- i.e. the font size must not be too small so that the number is difficult to read e.g. for a customer"
448,Legible marking - Cat2,"Verify that the marking of the meter's manufacturing number is clearly legible
- i.e. the font size must not be too small so that the number is difficult to read e.g. for a customer"
451,Location of the marking - Cat1,"Verify that the Meter's serial number is placed on a non-removable part (not connector cover, not Communication Module cover, etc.)."
452,Location of the label - Cat2,"Verify that the Meter's serial number is placed on a non-removable part (not connector cover, not Communication Module cover, etc.)."
478,Management of both primary and secondary registration - Cat1,Verify that the Metering Units can handle both primary and secondary recording of Metering Values.
483,Quantity of allowed faulty meters Cat1 - RISE,"During the expected lifetime of the Metering Units, the occurrence of faults (requiring meter replacement) shall not exceed 0.75 % per year of the installed volume."
484,Amount of allowed faulty meters Cat2 - RISE,"During the expected lifetime of the Metering Units, the occurrence of faults (requiring meter replacement) shall not exceed 0.75 % per year of the installed volume."
485,Lifetime Cat2,A Metering Unit shall have a life expectancy of 15 years from the date of delivery to GE.
646,Authentication against neighboring systems,Verify that authentication is used when the Metering System interacts with neighboring systems.
