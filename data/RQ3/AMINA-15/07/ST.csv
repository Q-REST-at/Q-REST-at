Disconnect the power on several phases. Connect production to the meter, and the measuring point in HES has a profile for consumption only. Unscrew a voltage fuse on the meter board so that an event is generated in the meter. Unscrew the 'zero' so that an event is generated in the meter. Use super magnet at the meter to cause an event in the meter. Set a low limit value in the meter. For both cat 1 and cat 2 - generate high current at meter to cause event. For both cat 1 and cat 2 - generate high power on meter to cause event. Generate overheating"

260,Selecting dates with calendar function,"Verify that where there is a need to select dates in HES, this is done through a time and calendar function."
331,Configure records to be stored for events,Verify that for each Event it is possible to optionally configure which registers (OBIS codes) in the Metering Unit should be stored.
339,Communication status - Cat1 1 phase,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
340,Communication status - Cat1 3 phase,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
341,Communication status - Cat2,"Verify that it is possible to view the communication status of the Metering Unit directly, without manual intervention and without opening the meter."
465,screw anchors - Cat2,Verify that there are no elevations around the Metering Unit's screw attachments that limit the size of the screw head.
466,screw anchors - Cat1,Verify that there are no elevations around the Metering Unit's screw attachments that limit the size of the screw head.
471,sealing device - Cat1,Verify that the sealing device of the Metering Unit is raised and clearly visible for smooth and accessible passage of the sealing wire.
472,sealing device - Cat2,Verify that the sealing device of the Metering Unit is raised and clearly visible for smooth and accessible passage of the sealing wire.
596,logging of events,Verify in HES that the events and their attribute values can be displayed in an event list.
616,Installation of new metering device via integration,Information regarding structure data for new set-up is sent from the integration interface Mint to Collection Manager. Verify that information entered on the user point in Collection Manager corresponds to what is specified in the Work Order. An acknowledgment is sent to Generis that the meter is set up in Collection Manager. Check that the user point is displayed under the correct coordinates in the map view in Vision. Check that the meter has the correct profile and that Energy values. PQ values and GSM diagnostics are pushed from the meter at the correct interval.
618,Dismantling of metering unit via integration,Information regarding the structure data for the removal of a metering unit is sent from the integration interface Mint to Collection Manager. Verify that the metering unit is removed in Collection Manager and does not have a connection to the user point.
619,Update of measurement point in CM,Information regarding the structure data for updating a metering unit is sent from the integration interface Mint to Collection Manager. Verify that the information to be updated via Mint has also been changed at the current user point.
620,New Metering Unit is set up in CM and taken down in ACM - Take down fails in ACM,Initiate a new set-up of a metering unit in CM and ensure that the metering unit is still in ACM when the new set-up is carried out in CM. A message is sent from CM to Generis stating that the metering unit in ACM is not taken down.
621,New Metering Unit is set up in CM and taken down in AiMiR - Take down fails in AiMiR,Initiate a new set-up of a metering unit in CM and ensure that the metering unit remains in AiMiR when the new set-up is carried out in CM. Mail is sent to the AiMir box.
622,New Metering Unit is set up in CM and taken down in ACM - Set-up fails in CM,Initiate a new set-up of a metering unit in CM and make sure that the metering unit is already connected to another facility in CM. Message is sent from CM to Generis stating that the metering unit is not created in CM.
623,New Metering Unit is set up in CM and taken down in AiMiR - Set-up fails in CM,Initiate a new set-up of a metering unit in CM and ensure that the metering unit is still in AiMir when the new set-up is carried out in CM.
