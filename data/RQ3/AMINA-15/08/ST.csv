616,Installation of new metering device via integration,Information regarding structure data for new set-up is sent from the integration interface Mint to Collection Manager. Verify that information entered on the user point in Collection Manager corresponds to what is specified in the Work Order. An acknowledgment is sent to Generis that the meter is set up in Collection Manager. Check that the user point is displayed under the correct coordinates in the map view in Vision. Check that the meter has the correct profile and that Energy values. PQ values and GSM diagnostics are pushed from the meter at the correct interval.
618,Dismantling of metering unit via integration,Information regarding the structure data for the removal of a metering unit is sent from the integration interface Mint to Collection Manager. Verify that the metering unit is removed in Collection Manager and does not have a connection to the user point.
619,Update of measurement point in CM,Information regarding the structure data for updating a metering unit is sent from the integration interface Mint to Collection Manager. Verify that the information to be updated via Mint has also been changed at the current user point.
620,New Metering Unit is set up in CM and taken down in ACM - Take down fails in ACM,Initiate a new set-up of a metering unit in CM and ensure that the metering unit is still in ACM when the new set-up is carried out in CM. A message is sent from CM to Generis stating that the metering unit in ACM is not taken down.
621,New Metering Unit is set up in CM and taken down in AiMiR - Take down fails in AiMiR,Initiate a new set-up of a metering unit in CM and ensure that the metering unit remains in AiMiR when the new set-up is carried out in CM. Mail is sent to the AiMir box.
622,New Metering Unit is set up in CM and taken down in ACM - Set-up fails in CM,Initiate a new set-up of a metering unit in CM and make sure that the metering unit is already connected to another facility in CM. Message is sent from CM to Generis stating that the metering unit is not created in CM.
