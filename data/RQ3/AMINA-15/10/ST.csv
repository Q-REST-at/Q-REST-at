ID,Purpose,Test steps
29,Switching on and off and status of breakers from other GE system,Verify that switching on is not possible by integration from other system. Verify that switching off is not possible by integration from other system. Verify that status of switches is possible to see by integration.
35,Traceable metering devices,Kamstrup demonstrates how components can be traced to batch and time of manufacture
58,Integrations via files,Put the import file in the import folder.
86,Testing tools,The Contractor shall use a tool designated by the Contracting Authority to follow the Contracting Authority's reporting of test results. The Supplier is responsible for registering in the tool its feedback and status on the Customer's reported errors and comments. The Client currently uses ReQtest in the defect management process.
87,The client's test case,The customer shall have the right to develop own and new test cases based on the Specification. New test cases can be created until Final Acceptance of the Delivery Project.
