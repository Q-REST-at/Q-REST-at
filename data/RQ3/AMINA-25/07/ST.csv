616,Installation of new metering device via integration,Information regarding structure data for new set-up is sent from the integration interface Mint to Collection Manager. Verify that information entered on the user point in Collection Manager corresponds to what is specified in the Work Order. An acknowledgment is sent to Generis that the meter is set up in Collection Manager. Check that the user point is displayed under the correct coordinates in the map view in Vision. Check that the meter has the correct profile and that Energy values. PQ values and GSM diagnostics are pushed from the meter at the correct interval.
618,Dismantling of metering unit via integration,Information regarding the structure data for the removal of a metering unit is sent from the integration interface Mint to Collection Manager. Verify that the metering unit is removed in Collection Manager and does not have a connection to the user point.
