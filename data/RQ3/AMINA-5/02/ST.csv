ID,Purpose,Test steps
43,Function of the metering unit after loss of phases on Cat1,Remove voltage on two of three phases
44,Function of the metering unit after phase loss on Cat2,Remove voltage on two of three phases
58,Integrations via files,Put the import file in the import folder.
220,Recording of measurement value,"Verify that the measured value recorded and stored in the HES is uncorrupted, i.e. exactly the same value as recorded by the Metering Unit.
Request a timestamped measurement value from the Meter and compare what is displayed on the Meter with the information coming into the HES."
404,View meters with communication problems in map,Verify that in HES it is possible to visualize Metering Units with communication problems in a graphical view/map that can be zoomed in and out.
489,Recovery time after communication breakdown max 60 min,Break the communication link from meter. Voltage is left in meter. Wait one hour and turn on the link again.
