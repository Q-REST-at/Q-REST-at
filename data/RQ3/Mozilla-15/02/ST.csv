T-30,"Purpose
This basic testcase is designed to verify that bookmarks and folders can't
  be dropped onto themselves, an immediate parent container or any child
  container.","Initial Conditions
You must have a bookmarks file. To promote consistency, you may choose to use the default set of Netscape Seamonkey Bookmarks , which I
    use. I have also provided the default Mozilla bookmarks file. You also have the option to use this very large bookmarks file . You must also customize your sidebar to include a bookmarks panel. As part of your bookmarks file you need a folder (lets' call it folder
    ""A"") that contains bookmarks and another folder (let's call this folder
    ""A 1 "" (read Asub1)) that contains bookmarks as well.

Steps/Description
Select Bookmarks|Manage Bookmarks. Select folder A 1 then drag&drop it onto or within
    itself Select folder A 1 then drag&drop it onto or within folder
    A. Select folder A then drag&drop it onto or within folder
    A 1 . Select a bookmark within folder A 1 and drop it onto folder
    A 1 .

Expected Results
Nothing should happen! No bookmark or folder should be moved in any of
    these cases. Ideally, one should see the International symbol for ""No""
    cursor."
