ID,Purpose,Test steps
T-3,,"1 - The user must enter the bar code of the source and his/her Z number via the barcode scanner and must be an authorized user.
2 – If the source is currently not located in its home repository, the user may still remove it but a warning message must be displayed instructing them to return it to the home repository when they have finished with it.
3 - A display must be presented indicating the source description and the transfer details.
4 - The user must be given the opportunity to complete the transfer, cancel the transfer, or complete the transfer and continue with additional transfers.
5 – If the transfer transaction completes successfully, the database must be updated with the new location and source owner.  
6 – If the user cancels the operation, no database update will be made.  
7 – If a source has an expired leak test date, it must not be allowed to be removed from the repository unless it is within the configured grace period.  Note: an error message should be displayed and an email message should be sent to the Custodian."
T-11,,"1 – The Custodian must enter his/her Z number using the barcode scanner and must be an authorized Nuclear Material Custodian.
2 – The Custodian must select which sources to inventory.  The Custodian must have the option to choose all sources, only checked-out sources, or only checked-in sources.  The sources chosen must be displayed.  Note: The information displayed for each source may include source bar code number, source ID, current owner, and current location.  A quick way for the Custodian to browse sources without affecting the inventory process should be provided.
3 – A running total must be displayed of sources that need to be confirmed, sources already confirmed, and sources that are unexpected (found at a location other than the current location in the database).
4 – The Custodian must enter the bar code of the source being inventoried using the barcode scanner.  The inventory date for that source must be updated in the database.
5 – If the leak test for a source being inventoried has expired, a message must be displayed stating that, along with the last leak test date.  Note: the leak testing being out of date should not stop the source from being confirmed for inventory purposes. 
6 – If the source is in an unexpected location, a message must be displayed stating the expected location (the current location logged in the database).
7 – If the Custodian quits confirming sources before the chosen sources are all confirmed, a message must be displayed warning the Custodian that the inventory is incomplete.
8 – When the Custodian has finished inventorying sources, a summarized list of sources just confirmed must be sent to the Custodian in an email message.  If a source is found in an unexpected location, it must be included in the summarized list.  If the Custodian cancels the inventory process, the summarized list of sources confirmed must be displayed.  Notes: The summary information is displayed upon cancellation because the email message may not be sent for an incomplete inventory.  The database is updated for all inventoried sources regardless of an email notification being sent or not."
