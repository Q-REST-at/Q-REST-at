SR10,Display Criticality and Fuel Rod Status for each of the Radiation Facilities,A capability must be provided to display criticality status for each building. 
SR11,Sample Source Transaction,"A capability must be added to perform a test source transaction to determine whether the transaction would exceed MAR, physical security, fuel rod or criticality limits."
SR12,Confirm inventory,A capability must be provided to confirm source inventory.  Note: An inventory of all registered sources is required by the Department of Energy (DOE) every six months.

SR16,Record Leak Testing,A capability must be provided to record that a source was leak tested.  Note: sources must be leak tested periodically as defined in ISD 121-1.1.
SR17,Verify leak testing,"Before a transfer is made of a source from one location to another, the leak testing status of that source must be checked to see if the leak testing is out of date or not. Note: leak test parameters are specified in ISD 121-1.1."
SR18,Automatic Database Backups,An automatic backup must be made of the central database every day.
SR19,Manually input MAR (CAT 3) contribution value for a source ,"A capability must be provided for the Custodian to manually enter a MAR (CAT 3) contribution override value used when verifying MAR limits.  Note:  If no override value is entered for a source, Source Tracker calculates the MAR contribution value."
SR20,Time-out timers,"A time-out timer must be provided for each transaction such that if the user does not complete a transaction within a time limit, the transaction is cancelled and the screen returns to the main menu.
